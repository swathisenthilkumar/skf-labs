# *Help wanted!*

Hello everybody!

Recently, we got granted a generous amount of money from  
our friends at [Contrast](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/). 
This grant helps us to develop more labs so we can expand our  
training curriculum on SKF.

## *Rules of engagement*

Here we describe what to expect when entering this exciting endeavor with us!

> - What is the work that needs to be done?
> - How much compensation can you expect for said work?
> - When is the work considered done?
> - Etiquette for participation
> - Getting started (workflow,templates,etc)
> - How to finally retrieve the compensation?

---

### *Getting started*

Getting started is simple:

> - Assign yourself an issue from the [project board](https://github.com/blabla1337/skf-labs/projects/2)
> - Create a Fork of the SKF-labs
> - Create a feature branch formatted as mentioned in *definition of done*
> - Use our standard CSS/templating found [here](https://github.com/blabla1337/skf-labs/tree/master/lab-template)
> - Use our standard write-up templating found [here](https://github.com/blabla1337/skf-labs/blob/master/template.md)
> - Tick off all the boxes from the issue
> - Create a PR for the SKF-labs main branch
> - If the PR is merged invoice OWASP
> - If the PR is merged assign the new ticket

It is very important for a lab to stick to our standard templating  
and styling. Please take this onto account very seriously.  

>The markdown of the labs that you are writing must
 be stored [ here ](https://github.com/blabla1337/skf-labs/tree/master/md/Python)

>And any screenshots that you are taking for the lab must be stored [here](https://github.com/blabla1337/skf-labs/tree/master/.gitbook/assets)

### *Definition of done*

As you can see in the issue there is a checklist provided of things that each contribution  
needs to contain before being eligible for compensation.  

 ![image of an open issue with checklist](/assets/images/tux.png)

After ticking off all the boxes, you can start creating a PR (pull request) for our main branch.  
please when creating a PR adhere your branch name to the following conversion:

Like:

`
<language>-<issue number>-<issue title>
`

Or finally:

`
python-1337-command_injection_WSTG_coverage
`

---

### *Participation Etiquette*

If you want to start on a lab, you can assign this lab to yourself.  
This is an indication for other contributors that this lab is already  
actively worked on and prevents duplicates. 

Now, we expect you to only assign 1 lab at a time so there is equal opportunity  
for other people to participate. 

After you have created your PR and the PR is approved and merged by the SKF   
team, you can claim another lab to work on :-)

---

### *compensenation*

Now, linked [here](https://link) you can find a new project board.  
In this project board, you will find a subset of labs that need to be developed!  
Each issue on the board has a label that indicates how difficult it is to  
develop the lab. Per difficulty level, we award a different amount  
of money when it is delivered.

| Label    | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Easy     | X      |
| Medium   | X      |
| Advanced | X      |
